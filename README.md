# Breast-Cancer-Classification

The project is designed to diagnose of breast cancer using mammogram images. The classifier is attainalbe by using nerual networks and transfer learning. This implementation allows users to get breast cancer predition by applying our models to an input image. 


## Getting Started

Download python 3 on the computer and download the code and packages listed below to your local machine to setup the model


### Prerequisites

Python
Jupyter Notebook
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Pytorch
torchvision
SciPy


### Installing

First to install python 3 onto your computer 

Then to install all the packages needed to run the programs

`pip install numpy pandas matplotlib Pytorch torchvision scipy`
`jupyter notebook` 

## Running the tests

The test consistes of several steps
1. data clearning and create data loader 
2. apply filters to the input images
3. run classifier
4. run the model and get the results


### Break down into end to end tests

The model is able to reach a validation accuracy of a%, precision a, recall a.

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

This model can make prediction about the input picture is either benign tumor or malignant tumor
